Defining new problems
========================

To include a problem in jMetalPy, it must implement the :code:`Problem` interface from the :py:mod:`jmetal.core.problem` module.

Use case: Subset Sum
------------------------

The goal is to find a subset S of W (list of non-negative integers) whose elements sum is closest to (without exceeding) C.
For example, for the input :math:`W=\{3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2\}` and :math:`C=9`, one output could be :math:`S=\{4, 5\}` (as it is a subset with sum 9).


In jMetalPy, this problem  can be encoded as a binary problem with one objective and one variable:

.. code-block:: python

   class SubsetSum(BinaryProblem):

      def __init__(self, C: int, W: list):
         super(SubsetSum, self).__init__(reference_front=None)
         self.C = C
         self.W = W

         self.number_of_bits = len(self.W)
         self.number_of_objectives = 1
         self.number_of_variables = 1
         self.number_of_constraints = 0

         self.obj_directions = [self.MAXIMIZE]
         self.obj_labels = ['Sum']

      def evaluate(self, solution: BinarySolution) -> BinarySolution:
         pass

      def create_solution(self) -> BinarySolution:
         pass

      def get_name(self) -> str:
         return 'Subset Sum'

Each solution consists of one objective function to be maximized to be as close as possible to :math:`C`:

.. math::
   \max{\sum_{i \in S}{s_i}}

In the former example, one solution could be created and evaluated as follows:

.. note::

   jMetalPy assumes minimization by default. Therefore, we will have to multiply the solution objective by :math:`-1.0`.

.. code-block:: python

   def evaluate(self, solution: BinarySolution) -> BinarySolution:
       total_sum = 0.0

       for index, bits in enumerate(solution.variables[0]):
           if bits:
               total_sum += self.W[index]

       if total_sum > self.C:
           total_sum = self.C - total_sum * 0.1

           if total_sum < 0.0:
               total_sum = 0.0

       solution.objectives[0] = -1.0 * total_sum

       return solution

   def create_solution(self) -> BinarySolution:
       new_solution = BinarySolution(number_of_variables=1, number_of_objectives=1)
       new_solution.variables[0] = \
           [True if random.randint(0, 1) == 0 else False for _ in range(self.number_of_bits)]

       return new_solution
